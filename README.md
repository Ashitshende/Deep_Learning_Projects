## Project 1: Weather Tweet  TextClassification : Predicting Confidence Scores with Artificial Neural Network.
The " Weather Tweet TesxtClassification : Predicting Confidence Scores with Artificial Neural Network.ipynb" file is one of the Deep learning projects in this repository.This project focuses on developing Deep learning model to predict confidence scores for sentiment, when, and kind labels in tweets related to weather conditions. It involves Importing data into pandas dataframe, exploratory data analysis, train-test splitting, tokenization and vectorization,building Artificial Neural Network(ANN) models. Three different ANN models were created for each label category, trained on labeled data, and enhanced through hyperparameter tuning, Keras callbacks,dropout regularization and tuning the bias-variance trade-off.Performance evaluation of this three models was done on Test set which gave reasonable accuracy.

Libraries:numpy,pandas,matplotlib.pyplot,seaborn,scikit learn,keras,Tensorflow

## Project 2: Cat Vs Dog Image Classification using CNN
In this project we successfully built a CNN classifier to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. With careful preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning,Callabcks and regularization, the model achieved a test accuracy of 0.8788. Further improvements in image size and hyperparameter tuning and reduction in overfitting could potentially enhance accuracy.the project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in Python for image classification tasks.
