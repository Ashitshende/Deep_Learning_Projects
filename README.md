## Project 1: Weather Tweet  TextClassification : Predicting Confidence Scores with Artificial Neural Network.
The " Weather Tweet TesxtClassification : Predicting Confidence Scores with Artificial Neural Network.ipynb" file is one of the Deep learning projects in this repository.This project focuses on developing Deep learning model to predict confidence scores for sentiment, when, and kind labels in tweets related to weather conditions. It involves Importing data into pandas dataframe, exploratory data analysis, train-test splitting, tokenization and vectorization,building Artificial Neural Network(ANN) models. Three different ANN models were created for each label category, trained on labeled data, and enhanced through hyperparameter tuning, Keras callbacks,dropout regularization and tuning the bias-variance trade-off.Performance evaluation of this three models was done on Test set which gave reasonable accuracy.
